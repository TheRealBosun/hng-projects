# hng-projects
This is what I'm using for my hng internship

hi,
thanks for this opportunity, my name is Abudu Ridwan Olatunbosun and I'm a graphic designer that wants more in thr field of design which is why I'm learning UI design and also Front-end development. though I chose Front-end here because i believe i have the creativity and skill to improve on the UI design since i was the onw who taught myself logo design and other graphic related skills. Thanks for giving me this chance and for reading whatever it is I have written.
also this Github is hard to use, maybe because its my first time.
